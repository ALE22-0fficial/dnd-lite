Holy-roller fighters, they have access to Priest spells. Unswerving devotion to their "faith" and if the enemy doesn't convert, they smack the Jesus/Krishna/Cthulhu into them!

A minor thing, but you have to be either Good or Bad (see *Alignment*) to be a Paladin. Unless you can convince the GM with a good and funny reason for an Indifferent Paladin!

## Skill bonuses

Skill bonuses reflect how well you can do a thing. These are based on your stats, including class bonuses. 

| Stat value | Skill Bonus |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 0 - 8      | +0          |
| 9 - 11     | +1          |
| 12 - 14    | +2          |
| 15 - 18    | +3          |

For example, we have a fighter, Steve the Mighty Clencher, with a base strength of 14. A fighter is a member of the Warrior class, this gives us a Strength bonus of +1, therefore our Strength is now 15. Simple maffs, innit. So, using the table above, our Strength Skill bonus is +3

## Hit points

These reflect how much damage you can take. If you lose 50% of your current total in one go, roll 2D6 under your CON to not go unconscious.

Starting Hit points = CON * 2   

## Alignment

This can affect how other people in the game behave towards you. Ever played Fable? Yeah like that...

### Good:

You help old ladies across the road and put money in charity boxes, you know, the little kiddie with dog outside the newsagents?

### Indifferent:

Old ladies can them across the road by themselves, unless they remind you of your Nan. And charity? WEll, that starts at home, unless it is for the ickle doggos and kitties.

## Bad:

You help old ladies under buses and charity boxes, well, that's just free money right?

## Weapons

Split in two broad groups, Ranged and Melee and categorised as Light, Medium or Heavy. If you are trying to use a weapon not in your proficiency list, it is -2 on your Attack roll. Some classes allow for Dual-wielding too!

| Weapon type | Damage |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Light       | 1D6    |
| Medium      | 2D6    |
| Heavy       | 3D6    |

### Ranged

| Light           | Medium    | Heavy    |
| --------------- | --------- | -------- |
| sling           | Short bow | Longbow  |
| Throwing knives | crossbow  | Arbalest |
| shuriken        | spear     | Arquebus |
| Pistol crossbow |           |          |

#### Range penalties

Ranged weapons suffer a penalty if you are trying to hit an enemy too close or too far away. The penalty is added to the enemy’s Defence score. 
Thankfully, the same thing happens when the enemy tries to fill you full of lead too!

|        | Close | Medium | Long | Extreme |
| ------ | ----- | ------ | ---- | ------- |
| Light  | +0    | +1     | +2   | +3      |
| Medium | +1    | +0     | +1   | +2      |
| Heavy  | +2    | +0     | +0   | +1      |

### Melee

These are split in Edged and Blunt

#### Edged

| Light       | Medium     | Heavy         |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Dagger      | Long sword | Bastard sword |
| Rapier      | Scimitar   | Battle Axe    |
| Hand axe    | Axe        | Naginata      |
| Short sword |            | Halberd       |

#### Blunt

| Light           | Medium       | Heavy      |
| --------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Knuckle dusters | Staves       | War hammer |
| club            | Mace         | Flail      |
| whip            | Sledgehammer |            |
| Hammer          |              |            |

### Dual wielding

A.k.a. "John Woo mode", you can fight with two light weapons, or one medium and one light weapon at the same time. 
One in each hand, obviously. This gets you two attacks in a combat round, yay! Except the left-hand, gets -1 to the ATK roll, boo! 
Yeah yeah, I know, the "off-hand" could be the right hand, but I'm right handed, so nerr nerr.

## Armor

Stuff wot you wear you keep your insides inside! If you are wearing armor not in your proficiency list, -2 to your Defence score or dodge roll. Armor comes in three types, Light, Medium, and Heavy.

####Defence bonus by Armor type####

| Armor type | Defence bonus |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| No armor   | +0            |
| Light      | +1            |
| Medium     | +2            |
| Heavy      | +3            |

####Armor types####

| Light           | Medium      | Heavy      |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Leather         | Chain shirt | Full plate |
| Studded leather | Scalemail   | Chain mail |
| Padded          | Half plate  |            |

You can also carry a shield, this will add +1 to you Defence bonus. You cannot use a two handed weapon and shield at the same time. 
You cannot use a shield with two-handed weapon, or if you are Dual-wielding. Unless your name is Zaphod Beeblebrox. i
And you had the third arm fitted to help with your ski-boxing.

## Skill checks

All skill checks follow the same format; roll 2D6 and add the appropriate skill bonus. You are aiming to get 8 or more on a roll including your bonus. 

For example, you want to hit someone, roll 2D6 and add your STR skill bonus. Another example, If you want to persuade someone to do something, roll 2D6, add you CHA skill bonus.

If you roll a double 1, that is a critical fail. Roll 2D6 under the base stat to not get a hilarious fuck up.

If you roll a double 6, that is a critical success! You have successed the game fun and get extra benefits.

What skills you have are up to you, if it is appropriate to your character. When you want to use a skill, check with the GM if they reckon it would be suitable.

## Combat

How to make friends by stabbing them…

Roll 2D6 + your DEX bonus for initiative, this determines turn order for the combat.

On your turn, you can do one of the following: attack, cast a spell, move, use an item (like a potion), or dodge.

### Attack

Opponents may be at close, medium, or long range; this can make it harder to hit them. The cheeky bastards may also be in cover; full, partial or none at all. Again, this can make them harder to hit. Not only that, but sometimes they are running! Guess what? Yep, that makes them harder to hit.

Choose an opponent, roll 2D6 and add either your STR bonus for melee or DEX bonus for ranged weapons. If the result is 8 or more, adjusted for the enemy’s armor, cover and movement, then you hit them, yay! 

If you rolled a double 1, fuck! That’s a critical miss, roll 2D6 and get under your DEX to hold onto the weapon and not look like an arse. 

If you rolled a double 6, ultra yay! That’s a critical hit, you get one extra D6 of damage to dish out and show off to the other players. 

If you hit them, roll the number of D6 your weapon type has for damage and proudly announce this to the group.

### Cast a spell

Combat is quick, don't try resurrecting anyone in that time or building a magic house. Enemies have a habit of shooting the pointy hat. If they do, you could suffer from *Magicus interruptus*, most embarrassing...

*Magicus interruptus*; if some inconsiderate bastard successfully attacks you while you are in the middle of casting a spell, you know, you have just throttled a chicken and spun round widdershins 3 times, but yet to perform the mystic sign of JubJub McGraw, then your spell goes *poof* and fails.

See *Magic* for spells 'n' that for how to cast a spell.


### Move

Moving in combat allows you to get into or out of range.

### Use an item

Like open a door, pull a lever etc

### Dodge

You are focusing on dodging incoming attacks this turn. Your Defence score increases by your DEX bonus.

## Magic

Some spells are instant, some take time. For example, good old Magic Missile takes one action, i.e. instant (according to the Player Handbook).

Spell targets can be in line of sight, touch or area effect. Check the manual if you ain't sure. 

To cast a spell, roll 2D6 and add your INT bonus to see if you successfully cast the spell. 

If you rolled a double 1, fuck! That's a critical miss, roll 2D6 under your INT to check your brain didn't melt out of your ears. Or worse.

If you rolled a double 6, yay! That's a critical success, you get one extra dice worth of effect, if applicable. if not, I'm sure the GM will come up with something horrible/hilarious.
