## Combat

How to make friends by stabbing them…

Roll 1d6 + your DEX bonus for initiative, this determines turn order for the combat.

On your turn, you can do one of the following: attack, cast a spell, move, use an item (like a potion), or dodge.


### Attack

Opponents may be at close, medium, or long range; this can make it harder to hit them. The cheeky bastards may also be in cover; full, partial or none at all. Again, this can make them harder to hit. Not only that, but sometimes they are running! Guess what? Yep, that makes them harder to hit.

Choose an opponent, roll 2d6 and add either your STR bonus for melee or DEX bonus for ranged weapons. If the result is 8 or more, adjusted for the enemy’s armor, cover and movement, then you hit them, yay! 

If you rolled a double 1, fuck! That’s a critical miss, roll 2d6 and get under your DEX to hold onto the weapon. 

If you rolled a double 6, ultra yay! That’s a critical hit, you get one extra d6 of damage to dish out. 

If you hit them, then roll the number of d6 your weapon type has for damage and proudly announce this to the group.


### Cast a spell

Some spells are instant, some take time. For example Magic Missile, takes one action (i.e. instant).

Spell targets can be in line of sight, touch or area effect, check the manual. Roll 2d6 + INT bonus to see if you successfully cast the spell. +8 is a success. Double 6 has increased effectiveness, Double 1 can lead to unconsciouness


### Move

Moving in combat allows you to get into or out of range.


### Use an item

Like open a door, pull a lever etc


### Dodge

You are focusing on dodging incoming attacks this turn. Your defend score increases by your DEX bonus.


## 


## Skill checks

All skill checks follow the same format; roll 2d6 and add the appropriate skill bonus. You are aiming to get 8 or more on a roll including your bonus. 

For example, you want to hit someone, roll 2d6 and add your STR skill bonus. Another example, If you want to persuade someone to do something, roll 2d6, add you CHA skill bonus.

If you roll a double 1, that is a critical fail. Roll 2d6 under the base stat to not get a hilarious fuck up.

If you roll a double 6, that is a critical success! You have successed the game fun and get extra benefits.

What skills you have are up to you, if it is appropriate to your character.
