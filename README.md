# dnd-lite

Super simple, super silly D&amp;D rules. Written for a birthday party group with little D&amp;D experience.

## Why?

Well, a friend and regular player in my group, was having a birthday party.

"Hey!" they said, "you know what would be fun?"

"Ten strippers and a desert island?" I asked.

"No, silly. How about you run a D&D game for the people coming to the party?"

Meep.

Anyways, it got me thinking, and rather than go full-bore 5th edition rules on their asses, I thought about the other game systems I've played; what works, what doesn't and then threw all that out in favour of building my own.

## Design philosophy

D&D Lite is designed (Ha! designed... I make myself laugh sometimes) to be played fast 'n' loose. With beer.

Like all good pen and paper games, the rules are there as a start point for the players and the GM to discuss. If what a player is trying to do seems plausible, then yeah, go for it. The GM may get the player to do a skill check to see if their madcap idea works.

Rather than use a kabillion dice of different Platonic solids (ha, yeah... platonic...), D&D Lite is based around two good old six-sided dice, refered to as D6. Everyone has 2D6 right? Right?

The rules are meant to be simple enough to get a game going, but have enough meat to them to be, well, fun!

## Licensing

D&D Lite is under the MIT license. Feel free to raise issues if you have ideas for enahncements or think something should be changed. But above all, it is meant to be daft and simple. And a bit sweary. I love paying RPGs, D&D is the best out there; this is a drunken homage to the awesomeness that Gary Gygax and friends nailed together over many play sessions.

Anyway, I hope you have fun with this, get them dice a'rollin!
